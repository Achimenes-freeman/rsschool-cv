### Briefly About Myself:

I love programming, it's exciting and interesting. As a teenager, I knew that I would become a programmer. Now I am actively studying JavaScript and React, and I have achieved no small success in this. I like to create websites and web applications, I like to learn something new and interesting. Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to work in an IT company yet, but I hope to find a great place where I can realize my full potential to the maximum.
